# MeetUp

MeetUp Android App

This is an android app for a course that I took. It finds two students' schedules and determines if they are within proximity to meet up. A route is plotted for them to get to the nearest food destination they can meet up if they are both free. This app uses the foursquare API to retrieve information about buildings at UBC and food vendors near UBC. The mapquest API was used to draw the route from one place to another.
